# Ajax Multiple Image Uploader
A multiple image uploader based on ajax.

This image uploader is an improvement of <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload">jQuery File Upload</a> written by <a href="#">Sebastian Tschan - blueimp</a>. The only improvement is adding the support of multiple image uploads with removable image thumbnails.So, the credits must be go to the original author of this great plugin. 

And the other improvement is this uploader is focusing on image upload. It does not support other files. But you can customize the server side code to add the suport to other files as well. That's totally upto you!
